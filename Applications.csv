If I looked back and thought of a nice house, my mini games and shops, I would consider it a win","The very first thing that made me open the game was the sound. On the PS3 my brother had Minecraft. And when I was alone I would listen to the tune and look at the screen with Steve and Alex, their dog and mobs coming out of the cave. It looked happy. So I went onto the game and was immediately confused on what to do. I dropped the game for weeks. Then I got my sister over to try it with me. The first world I spent time on was called Rory Lilly neighborhood. We called it a “get ready world” we would get stuff in creative, then go in survival. We have probably over 600 hours on that world alone. We would build. Attempt redstone (we would fail) we both loved it. But inevitably, we got bored. Fast forward a year or two, I get an Xbox for Christmas. I just so happen to find a friend in school who also had an xbox. So, we set up worlds (that went nowhere) and we were ultimately, both bad at the game. We would cheat on iron ore instead of diamonds or food or anything else. We both sucked and we were fine with it. Then, I stopped playing Minecraft for a 2 years. When I pick up the game again, I somehow got better in a way. Instead of stopping when I got wood tools, I would stop when I got stone tools or iron. I played for a while the again, stopped for 3 months this time. But, I somehow got even better. I started building what came to mind. It was my new thing that I did. Building. This was the time that I found Hermitcraft. S6 ep78 by Grian. I watched and saw the amazing things he built. I got more inspired then ever. I would wake up at 6:00 am every single day and start building. Houses, caves, trees, anything that I wanted. I was really good at the time. I would watch grian’s tutorials on windows and such.this then came to the obsession of wanting to be on a Hermitcraft like server. I looked on xbox posts and would look for hours at a time. (This is cutting into 2020 btw) eventually, I found one. It was a Hermitcraft inspired realm. I was kinda bad at survival. But, they taught me things. Like, how to make a simple automatic sugar cane farm. I really enjoyed this realm. But, I found out something that made me question wether I should stay in the realm. They had cheats. The owner would tp away from danger. The other members hated it but the owner was fine with it. Eventually, a member released a wither and it destroyed everything. Then the owner made a new realm in hope that this one would be better. I immediately started teaming with a member called jack. He helped me get iron armor and stuff. We also got diamonds and some diamond tools along with armor. It was cool. But the owner (Fuji) still had iron armor and was mad. I also fished, so I had good enchants early game. And me and Jack got villagers and lived together. It was fun always having something to do. And then me and Jack needed dark oak for a massive build for the villagers. But we needed shoulder boxes so we decided to fight the ender dragon. We found a stronghold in the ravine near the village. So we prepared to fight it. And we went to fight it, and we killed it. It was my first time beating the ender dragon. We went to raid end cities but. Jack stayed up for 27 hours trying to find a end city with a ship and there was no luck. He got shulker boxes but no elytras. So we serif to get dark oak and we went 8000 blocks with no elytra. And found a dark oak! We filled up 2 shulker boxes of logs. When we went home I started constructing a house for villagers. I eventually had the frame layer out. Then I started filling In the house and the outside was done. And it looked pretty cool. And then the worst happened. Fuji deleted the realm. Everything was gone. Then he blocked me and Jack. So, I had to start my own realm, which took a while. And the world loaded up and it was a good seed and everything we needed. And we started getting people on the realm and it was kinda fun. We found a single cave with 4 spawners in it. We were having a lot of fun with my new realm. Eventually, we got netherite, and elytra but still no one to play with. It kinda sucked. We had full power beacon and haste 2. We just had everything and we got bored. Then, I started a new realm. Jack never played on it though. He had school and other things in his life to do. So I took the liberty of getting new people every day. I found someone but he wasn’t too exciting at first. But he was about the same age as me, he was about as good at the game as me and we were just good friends. And then I discovered that Jack May have been duplicating items. He had a gunpowder farm on the last realm but when I accused him of duping tnt he said the design he used made 55k per hour. Which mad no sense at all. So I banned him and blocked him for lying. Then scp, (the guy I mentioned earlier) was my new realm partner. We tried every day to get people but we only ever got one person. He was really good at redstone. But he never played so we banned him. And I eventually banned scp for being a jerk. I then just got bored of my realms. Getting people was too hard. (This is leading up to the present day) I started looking at posts on discord. And just a couple of days ago, I found a realm on my main account which I really enjoy. I worked on a custom design for a skelly spawner, got diamonds and made a base. I love the realm a lot. But that leads me to right now! Thank you for reading this whole thing. Note: I am much much much better at the game than I used to be. Please consider what I just typed out. I have dreamed about being in a Hermitcraft inspired realm since I saw Hermitcraft. I left out a lot when typing this. I left out around a year worth of details In this story but I have been typing for 2 hours so ima stop now",,,,,,,

Sometimes, the end goal for me is to build a house and the I am done, but other times I want to go all out, collecting everything building the biggest base and all of it. I guess the real end goal for me would be if I am satisfied and had fun.","As I said before, I started playing Minecraft when I was 5 on the family Laptop. My mother would always assign us the ""Chores for an Hour"" chart, where we would complete our listed chores, and get an hour of screen time. Of course, this didn't last long and I ended up spending 2 to 3 hours on Minecraft doing mindless block placements thinking it looked good. Eventually it got to the point where the family laptop became redundant, so I was given it. Since I now owned it, I played Minecraft non-stop. My mother was protective though, and up until this point I had never heard of servers or was even allowed on YouTube. I would try and sneak my ways onto the servers, mainly servers with creative building options because I guess I had always just wanted to hang out with some people online. It seemed fun to me, and interesting. Because I was a bad child, I would try my hardest to sneak ways to watch YouTube on my iPod, and I had some ""creative"" methods, but this introduction to YouTube was what showed me how talented other people were, and it showed me how much better it is to learn from others, instead of learning from your own errors. After discovering the world of YouTube, things moved on in life, I grew up, my mom stopped caring about what videos I watched, or what servers I played on, and when I realized she had stopped caring was when I really set off into the world of SMPs. I  jumped in between so many trying to find an active community. There would be one here saying they were active, but nope! After a while I stumbled upon Architech, and you already know what happened here. After that whole arc I had begun browsing twitch one day I found a small streamer with 1 or 2 viewers, and thought, ""Hey, Lets make his day and follow him!"" and I did, and that started what I will call the Attempt at Broville Arc. This streamer was quite an ambitious fella, after getting to know him for a month or 2, he invited me to a ""secret project"" which turned out to be his attempt at Broville V12. I didn't know what Broville was, but after downloaded the V11 map, I was impressed. He asked me to join, I said yes and after getting accepted by the others, I begun work on it. After a while, it sadly also died out along with the idea of a Broville V12. I began to SMP hop again trying to find the one. after joining the Minecraft discord, i browsed lfg, and came across someone (that's you guys) advertising a Hermitcraft like server, with dedicated players. I thought cool! Sounds fun, and I might meet some new friends. I sent a message to the advertiser, and boom, here I am writing this out for you to read.",,,,,,,

I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and traveling in real life.","To me, the end goal of a successful Minecraft server/world is to have fabulous builds, farms, and most importantly have FUN. Fun is all a game is about, I sometimes do stuff not in the most efficiency way but in the fun way, because fun is all that matters really.","It's a long story, please seat yourself comfortably as I tell you my relations with Minecraft. I first got introduced in the game back in China, when the game was in it's very early stages, and pistons weren't even a thing. Back then it was really popular among my friend group, but however I just really don't get it. So when someone ask me ""hey do you play Minecraft?"" I would be like ""yea, I know that game."" But if they try discussing it with me I would have a hard time. Slowly over the years I would get a little better at minecraft. The first server that I enjoyed I just spend most of my time building crappy houses and mining diamond with pickaxe. Most of the time I would just blow holes in my creative world until I get bored of myself. 

It would continue like this until I decide to actually play minecraft on java. I started watching let's plays, and from that I got inspirations on how to grow my world. 8 months ago I join this server called lunar. From there my skills grow exponentially. I got to know Hermit Craft, and from there I learned to make farms and mega bases. I was also heavily influenced by a player in the server called Calijero. He's really experienced at farming and good at making bases. Kind of your average hermit. I would go on to refine my building and farming/grinding skills. My goal on that server was to make my first-ever all items sorter. It have 2 double chest of storage for every item in minecraft (stackable ofc.) I kind of finished it before the mass ban. 

Now you're probably curious why I got banned in the first place, here let me explain. The admin of that server is very strict and pricky. So anyways, one day I decided to prank a player by killing him. (ofc I gived his stuff back). For some reason that player got really mad at me. I was confused because he killed me before too, so I thought it would be ok for me to prank him back in the same way. He started swearing at me and saying really disguesting stuff. The admin came and held me accountable for starting drama. And Perm banned me. No appeal no nothing. He won't even give me a world download for my hard work. Anyways, I went on findind a new server, but so far didn't find any good ones. After a few week, I was informed by a friend still in that server that the admin, for some reason, decided to mass ban like 50% of players there, and start a new server. These players know me, so some of them came to me and wish to find a new server that's HC like and have a good community (such as this one). One of them is the guy I mentioned that bestened my play time. The few of them are experienced, friendly, and dedicated players. Their ign are: xLocutus, bbythatsdiamond, Salvador, and AgroBorga. So that's my story so far. I hope me and my friends can qualify for this server, if we do we'll be really active and bring a lot of value to Nodecraft.",,,,,,,

I like to have sort of a min goal so like at the start, build a house, then make farms, go mining those sort of things.

It's never the end in a game where its fuel is your creativity. ","kinda deep question aha. i mostly started out on MC as it was sort of an escape which im sure is the same for alot of people and i was going through a hard time. at the time, i wasnt told that i actually have OCD and ADHD so i was just really lost and minecraft helped me forget about the fact that I kept getting so obsessed over every little detail even if it was for an hour or so because it was my world sort of thing, I made the rules. which is just an OCD persons dream. Ive met SO many good people within the world of minecraft, some that have meant much more then others and some that i still talk to like 4 years later and they're now starting a family  or even going to college which is crazy. Like i said before, as i started on the ps4 legacy i was on a bunch of worlds/servers that never really fell through. I even hosted a fair few myself as i was so sick of the constant ending of a world when ive just got into it and got into the swing as it takes me a couple of days (sometimes a week) to realy settle in. all the worlds on ps4 was alright, never amazing just because it was a prue vanilia where it was no plugins or anything. there is a few that I would defo never join back but overall it was okay. there is also a couple of PC servers that I've joined too that have worked out quite well but have never lasted or got shut down due to whatever reasons.  ive built alot of things that are better then others in my run. Overall i really use mc as an escape from life and really try to enjoy myself.",,,,,,,

I was very sad for weeks (i know it sounds super dumb, a virtual dog, but i had a weird special bond with him) i made a grave in his honor, his name was Johnny. After that i decided to join a server and play with people, i dont have many friends at school, people find me weird. Well, when i joined my first server, it got griefed imidietly, i didnt have time to build anything cool, i just made a starter base. The second server wasnt griefed, but everyone just didnt know how to build and always stole my stuff, after those experiences i stopped playing in servers and decided to play different games, i heard of a cool game called astroneer, i played it for 3 months and came back to minecraft with increadible space builds ideas, i built them all, and from there i started watching hermitcraft, i decided to go back to trying servers and found a good one, it was going super good, i made lots of friends and all, i had a great time, until the 1 thing  that made me stop joining server a long time ago started on this server, my base got completely destroyed by some random hacker, luckaly, there was a backup so everything was saved, the season ended, i said bye to my friends and entered my survival world again.

but my moto is that ´´minecraft is not defeatable´´it inspires me many times as its infinite ","1st time I got introduced to the game was on a cracked edition of Minecraft, where I also started my 1st singleplayer. later on, bought premium.
later on, I gained an interest in a minigame server like hypixel but quickly lost it because I didn't find myself in it, so I started searching and I started playing skyblock competitively the old SB, not hypixel kind or PVP-wars kind they too modded.
and after I've lost interest in that I found my self in survival and I'm in survival for about 2years now probably already. and here at 1st I was just experimenting with farm and builds and mechanics, at that time I was also watching tons upon tons of YT vids that were explaining its mechanics. Me and friends started a server ourselves so I also have some experience in server hosting, but later on, friends lost their interest then I went to play on some public server I became a helper there EZ and thought that's it but after 400h of gameplay there I quitted because there was no community established for vanilla MC. but mostly for modified survival with buyable spawners.. etc. 
and so I started searching on Minecraft server disc for servers that are hermit craft-like. I have gone thru many but none had a community that could be sustainable.
and so I came along to u on the same day I found ur server I was majorly denied on some server only because of my age but they weren't as organized as u so I'm kinda happy now that I found you.",,,,,,,

Despite not owning the game I still already knew a lot about it, so when I got minecraft bedrock, I spent hours on it. Fast forward a few years (Maybe 2) and I got Java edition. At this time I had gotten into programming and decided to make a server, which turned out to be harder than I had expected and while it was a failure, I learned from it and continued trying to make servers.
Because of this, I meat many new people and learned just how much more to the game there was other than gameplay. Around 4 years ago I had back surgery and had to stay at home for 4 mounth. During this time I took some break from the game and did otherthings. That winter I got back into the game and succeeded in making ClashMobs an rpg server that is still being worked on today. Also one of the staff, Noodlegamer76, started the Noodlecraft smp, based on hermitcraft and I spent MONTHS on the game. Iv been playing quite a lot ever sense, taking breaks here and there as to not neglect my actuall life. Now Im here. Hopfully I can have some fun with you guys too!",,,,,,,

I started playing Minecraft when I was about 8 or 9, on Pocket edition. I started playing because I heard a lot about it from other kids at my school and wanted to check it out. I mostly played survival, just casually. I liked to build things and just create a nice little world for myself, didn't really have a lot of friends in elementary so I just played video games instead. When I was about 11 I got java edition, this is when I really started playing on servers. My favorite was this one called ""shotbow"" which had a dedicated creative building server. The way it worked is if you built something well you could get it reviewed and if your build ""passed"" you would get a higher rank and access to larger plots and eventually world edit. They also hosted building competitions similar to a 'build battle' with a chosen theme or block palette and the time limit was an hour and you got to use world edit. You didn't win anything, but it was a lot of fun and good practice. My best builds are on that server but unfortunately it's shut down now and I didn't think to take screenshots. The biggest build I did was a big sandstone desert island with a big seaside town, which had a dragon dormant underneath it. I also invited some of my friends on the server to put little ""Easter eggs"" in the caves inside it, there ended up being a big underground market when everything was done. My computer really doesn't work as well as it used to so now I use bedrock edition. I mostly play survival nowadays and like to build farms and whatnot. I also play minigames on the hive every now and then.",,,,,,,

2018 august/september.  ~  2020 
from the very first time opening the game i was hooked after finding my first diamonds on a small LAN world with two old friends, shortly after i got to grips off the game with the help off them i started a singleplayer world i had a few off these all as bad as each other but i was new i was still trying to figure out building styles, only thing i could do is redstone with the aid off Youtube videos, but it worked i went from learning how to make an auto sugar cane farm using observers and pistons, to learning about repeaters, to well no one understands comparators fully but i know how to use them in certain situations now. 
a few worlds came and went where me and a few other mates would start some SMP's that didnt last as there just wasnt time for us both to be online at the same time so i went back onto single player worlds for the majority off 2019, started expanding my knowledge and read the gamepedia wiki on minecraft started to understand the mechanics more and became the person people come to, for infomation about the games unique way off working. This happened for around 6 months off just offline play, i joined a few servers that are built into xbox bedrock however i just didnt get the same vibe. 

then it was 2020, minecraft was still popular, so we spoke about starting a realm so we can all still play together but with the ease off not having to all be online, this worked really well till about July. we went through 3 world in this time as we had griefing in the first world that as we tried to take a back up file the file was corrupted so season 2 started, there was only a few off us left at this time and the seed was pretty wack but it lasted like 3 months, we all had significantly large homes, my industrial district was working hard with my cactus farm bringing in 2 stacks off cacti every 20 -25 mins, 5 stacks off bamboo being harvested at a time and 2.5 stacks off sugarcane farm every 20 mins. i had a full selection off wool and a semi automatic cow farm inspired by season 2 hermit craft within the town centre. the world ended as the release off 1.16 started, we went into season 3 however arguments happened and everyone other than 3 off us stopped playing the atmosphere was dull now within the first 2 weeks off playing it, i just started working on my sand castle in this world aswell, one off my proudest builds, shortly after the realm ended due to the fact the owner stopped playing on it, i went back to single player and enjoyed it alot more as i could do what i want from there on without no one telling me what to do as my mate was verry picky and everythinng in the comunal area had to be his way, however this was down to his autism so we just carried on with his words,  since then i havent really done no big projects ive had a few ideas since but never cracked on with it as i dont see the point in doing it if im putting all the effort in and no one in that world is gonna see it other than myself. that leads me onto now, xbox update made all my world's disappear unfortunately so i have started a new one the past 2 days, currently sat in a wooden shack on the beach front, with a 2 stack sugar cane farm that is manual however the harvest brings in 4 stacks, a full enchantment setup, just the basic suvival starter base theres not much to say as theres not much here. i hope you have enjoyed reading this, i know it probably quite generic however thats the story off NotNormalBen",,,,,,,

We played on his old Xbox 360 and made a creative world in the Skyrim texture pack. Then I got the game on my own and made my own survival world. It went really well. I did not play Minecraft for a while after that till I got my pc. Then my friend Jake and I made a survival world with some others. It was a beautiful world but got deleted by the creator our friend Aidan. He made another world where Adian, Jayden, Jake, and I played for about 1 month. After that me and Jayden began playing bedwars. He was the better player and was the force of our team. I built the bed defense then went and destroyed 1 or 2 beds using my brain and not my cps. Soon he along with my other friends stopped playing Minecraft and I started to search for smp's to join, after discovering the Dream smp. I joined the Niwa smp where the owner Niwa and someone named Zyrizzz were terrorizing the people of the smp. I went over to them and waited. I saw one of them die and before they could respond I ran over and took everything. I put it in a nearby ender chest and proceed to get all of the owner and his partner's cannon lives taken by my hands and plans. They made me the king of the smp till Niwa restarted the server and used creative to give him and me everything we ever wanted. In the end I betray him and took his last canon life again. After that the smp was kinda of dull and I wanted an smp that had people but not too many and was more professional. So I found this place and it seems like a cool place and I would love to be in it.",,,,,,,

The worst parts are when everything is lost. when everything you have worked so hard to make is taken away from you. It especially hurts when someone else then uses what you made to do something bad that you did not intend it to be used for.

I was always interested in mods and game altering so I wanted to learn how to do commands.. obviously it was Xbox 360 edition so yeah I didn't have much luck with that.. but my mom ended up buying me my own Xbox 360 but I never had Xbox live so I just played by myself and went over to my friends house when I could.. I didn't really meet anyone thought this time bc I didn't have Xbox live.. but fast forward a half a year and I saved up to get an Xbox one, the only game I got was Minecraft.. but there was something weird about it.. it looked like mobile.. and it said ""bedrock edition"" it was weird so I decided to look it up on youtube... And there it was a gold mine of content such as farms, commands, smp's, survival series, and modded survival.. I wanted to learn commands so I found a YouTube video and began watching it.. throughout the first year I began playing bedrock I got Xbox live and starting learning pvp.. all of the windows 10 people I watched made me think of how easy it would be to pvp on a keyboard and mouse instead of a controller so I bought a USB hub and a keyboard and mouse.. I started to learn  commands and more and more basics of Minecraft.. it's been about 2 and a half years since I got my keyboard and mouse and ive gotten better at Minecraft in general including pvp and farms.. throughout this time I've been looking for a reliable smp to find.. and I hope I've found it with this server.. whoever's reading this thank you for your time 🌹",,,,,,,

Early game (Group A)
Finding my footing (Group B)
Trying to fix the unfixable (Group C)
Mourning period (Group D)
Now

Early game:
 My first 3 years of playing minecraft were what you would expect from an 8-11 year old: A lot of creative mode, and immaturity. From thinking that naming every villager to Bob is funny to putting signs up that said ""You're stinky"" in single player worlds. I don't remember much from ages 8-9, however I do remember the later years. See, I used to play with my friend Ross on our PS Vitas. We had a pokemon themed world (That wasn't very pokemon like). I remember us building a huge Tepig, that was a restaurant. We built parkour areas, PokeGyms, Hospitals, I had a junk shop that just had mass amounts of everyday items. One time, we tried getting an achievement, i forget the name of it, but you needed to fill a double chest with cobblestone. Halfway through it, he looked at me and went ""Hold on, this is a creative world, right?""
""Yeah, why?""
""...You can't get achievements in creative""
You should've seen the look on my face, almost half an hour of mining out a crater for nothing. Still quite funny though.
When I moved back onto my PC for minecraft i got me and my mates to join a factions server which you can see what happened in the Best experience question. After the faction died off, we played a lot of bed wars (More than i like to admit, considering i'm still rubbish at the game) but one day Realms had come out, so obviously I brought one. I got my mates on there, and we built world after world (These friends will be reffered to as Group A). We used to reset quite a lot, and i'm actually quite sad that i lost those worlds, as that is what helped me realise that Minecraft is more fun with other people. I don't recall much, but I just remember everyone slowly leaving one by one, which is down to the fact that we all moved to different schools (We were in primary school, which is the american equivalent to elementary), so sadly the realm sort of died off. The group split apart, but that wasn't that bad, as we all knew it was going to happen eventually.

Finding my footing:
There were three of us left from Group A, and we wanted to have a war type thing, a 2v2 situation. But, being only 3 people, i needed to get someone else. So, I asked around at school and found a kid that had minecraft, we'll call him dolphin. After sitting in a skype call for a bit, we realised we had quite a bit in common, and became friends quite quickly. I don't remember much of the war we tried to do, i just know that the last of Group A was gone. It was me and dolphin. Dolphin already had some online friends tho, so i joined a lot of discord servers, and thus eventually becoming friends with these dudes and letting them on the realm. This was Group B. It was 5/6 of us, but it was comfortable. We used the realm as our own SMP, but me and dolphin used to argue once a week, and it was kind of messy.
These worlds we built, they were quite good. We made towns, cities, defended villages and raided dungeons. Everything you would expect from an 11-14 year old, we did.The last world from Group B was probably my favourite world i've ever played on, I spent an hour or two in the evening just expanding my base. I made a decent sized storage room, a dog room, target practice, secret entrances, piston doors, it was all in good spirit. And it was fun, but it didn't last forever.
After a fun few years, I basically got kicked from the group. Dolphin decided he hated me, and kicked me from everything. I'm thankful though, after finding out what the group was really like, I dodged the bullet. But, the realm was still up, and it had no players.

Trying to fix the unfixable:
Group B was gone, and i needed to populate my realm. So I made some posts on the minecraft lfg, and got some players. But this only lasted 2 months, as the entire thing died out quickly. I don't want to go into detail, as killing something you've had for nearly 5 years is painful, so i'll give a quick summary of Group C
We split into two areas, but my area died out as people stopped playing, why did people stop playing? Because the other group speed ran the game, leaving us with nothing to do. Which isn't a *big* problem, as i tried getting everyone together in an attempt to populate it. The idea? Make a huge city, which comprised of our own individual mega bases, the plan would've been huge, beautiful and would've showed the peak of minecraft. But, combine demotivation with uninspired people and you'll get yourself a dead server.
So, Group C died as it lived, rushed, and little to no bonds.

Mourning:
Mourning is the most recent period, the loss of my realm and all my online friends left me basically alone. I found a minecraft server on the lfg and joined it. Luckily, that would find me being basemates with the best player i've ever met. Her username was Pixonii. We got on really well, and were quite good mates. The base I built with her was the first time I had ever gone for a more farmyard, cottagecore look to my builds, as before I had only ever really gone foreboding castle. This player, this human, showed me that you can build anything, if you put your mind to it. Sadly, she suddenly went offline without a trace, and left me in the dark. The server we were on, well the owner tried getting us to pay for access, so I left it. And after wandering around for a while, I found the SMP I'm on rn.
This server, it was good. I started properly playing it in september, and it was pretty fun, made an alright base, and became friends with a few of the people on there. But then the ownership changed, and was given to someone we'll call Star. Star was the most immature out of all of us, and was the most inactive. The fact he hadn't been kicked due to inactivity was a marvel, but eventually, things became worse. He basically stopped playing, and was pretty useless with his responsibility. He allowed a third party to control his actions, which led to one of the admins being kicked. But the people in the server are good. They're cool people, i've befriended some of them, but the problem is, the people on the server barely interact, and nobody has gone on it today. I've seen a lot of servers die in my life, so I'm trying  to hop ship before I sink with it.

Which leads us to now, I'm in need for a fresh start, with fresh people, and a fresh way of playing. I have plans for mega bases, farms, what not but I need the right place to do it.",,,,,,,

It has been 8 beatiful years together with this game. Explored thousands of servers and met tens of thousands of cool minecraft players from around the globe. I have built countless cities, compounds and fortresses, lost everything you can lose in this game - inventories of diamonds, elytras and obviously friends.

They probably banned me for being in other servers and they did not state that it was not allowed in the rules. I felt bullied so I started searching up servers with an actual community not suppressed by tyrants.,,,,,,,

That's what I love about the game, it has no end, no goal that you have to do.","If I had a story, I would tell you about my life. I was born in South Korea, and moved to America at a young age so I learned English almost as a first language so I'm good at it. There Minecraft blew up in 2015, and I literally begged my dad to get it for me, and he did. Then my Ninja world happened and I got to play the game a lot. After living there for about 5 years I moved back to Korea, and there I made so much friends. I have 3 best friends that I met there, and we all came together through Minecraft. The story is that one day I met this kid before school year, and we became pretty close. His name was Max and I got him to play Minecraft. We played every weekend at someone's house on our laptops and goofed around in creative. Then our school year started. Funny enough, we were in the same homeroom. In Korea, the people you are with at the start of the year never changes through the whole year. There we met Matthew, he saw us talking about Minecraft at lunch and asked if we could play with him. Same thing happened just like me and Max, and we were friends. Then the same thing happened again with someone joining our group, called Sunwoo. We played on a server called Hypixel, and we liked Skywars. I played that a lot. But in one of our years in school we kind of fell apart for about a year, because we weren't in the same homeroom. Then in our 6th grade, we got real close to each other and we started playing Minecraft again. Then Matthew moved out to different town, because they had better schools there. We played Overwatch for about a year, between me and Mathew and Sunwoo. Max's mom didn't like him playing video games anymore, so he kind of fell apart, but every time we met he always joined us. Then I got to move to America again, because of dad's job. It's only been about 4 months since I moved here to New Jeresey, but we still play Hypixel Bedwars every Saturday. This is how I got to play Minecraft, and how I met all my closest friends through Minecraft. This is why I love the game so much, and I love to play it. If you read this until now, Thank you very much and I am honored that you considered me to join your SMP.",,,,,,,

I worked for two years on a world that I still have on my 360s hard drive but it would be hard to transfer it over considering I don't have a flash drive. But I always begged my buddy to get off of halo:Reach and hop on some craft. Even to this day I'm begging some of my buddies to get online but they always have better things to do than, ""play with blocks"" is how they put it. But regardless of all the hate from other people on the game, it's still one of my favorites and I'll probably come back and play it on and off forever.

What got me here was the search for others who were serious about uploading and finding avid minecraft players in general.

Recently, I have noticed I no longer enjoy playing by myself knowing there is such a large community of players, and have been searching for a group that is my cup of tea. After playing creative for a few years, I find that I enjoy large scale projects in survival much more. Once I spent a year building a city (as most do), and the crowning achievement was a custom racetrack with a Mario Kart atmosphere.

I love that this game is a way to constantly improve upon one's problem solving skills, artistic sense, procedural thinking etc. Additionally, being able to set long term goals for a Minecraft world and continue working towards them even when the end goal seems extremely distant has truly helped me with real-life goals and endeavors that may not seem particularly fun in the moment but will be extremely rewarding when they eventually come to fruition. Besides the fact that this game has resulted and will continue to result in great self-improvement, I am motivated by the fact that the game is just downright fun (especially when played with good people!)",As long as it lasts,"Ilmango, Mumbo, Grian, Iskall, other hermitcrafters","I would say that my top goal would be to make good friends on a Minecraft server full of good-hearted people that take the game seriously and respect their fellow players. As far as purely in-game goals, I would absolutely love to put a lot more focus than I ever have on the aesthetic side of the game. I have always been focused almost exclusively on building things that are functional and challenging my brain to make redstone contraptions or efficient farms while neglecting to put a lot of effort into making things look good. I would hope to join this server and learn from people whose artistic senses are far better than mine so that I can combine my skill with redstone and farms with an ability to create things that are aesthetically pleasing.","I think a great Minecraft community comes from a group of people who are dedicated to making the game experience better for everyone on the server, not just themselves. I think that a good balance is that everyone follows the rules put forth not because they feel like they have to, but because they understand that everyone following the guidelines will result in the absolute best game experience for everyone involved. Additionally, I think that people having a sense of humor is vital. However, knowing what is and is not too far for a prank or joke is the key that allows people to have fun on the server.","I believe I can do a great deal to contribute to this community. Firstly, I will make sure to have fun on the server while also making sure not to interfere with anyone else's ability to have fun. Secondly, I will contribute to the community by immersing myself in it. I am an extremely social person (on Minecraft at least) and I will make sure to meet and become friends with everyone on the server! I think I can bring a unique energy and sense of humor to the server. Finally, I believe that some of the builds I could make would contribute to the overall quality of the server.","The only other game I play at the moment is Among Us, although recently I have played Skyrim and the Resident Evil 2 remake. No game comes even close in priority to Minecraft, though. In terms of real life hobbies, fitness and nutrition are important to me, and I enjoy working out and working to keep my body and mind in the best shape they can be! Finally, although I have not yet started, I am extremely interested in getting into Twitch streaming! Although it would be great to become a large streamer and be successful on the platform, my main goal is just to have fun and hopefully entertain some people!","I wouldn't say I have an end goal, the beauty of Minecraft is that there is no end to the possibilities. My only hope is that by the end of the server I've used the time spent to create the best things I can and improve the game experience for the others on the server.","I had played a bit of Minecraft in early high school, but not in any serious capacity and, frankly, not very well. I found other games that interested me more at the time and spent the good majority of my time playing and loving those games. It was not until much later, around 3 years ago, when I was surfing through YouTube and come across some videos showcasing some of the amazing things some people were capable of doing on this game. Prior to this, I had no concept of just how awesome this game really is and the infinite possibilities it contains. Becoming very interested, I first bought the Pocket Edition game in 2017 and absolutely loved playing it. Although the things I made at the time were either extremely simple or taken directly from someone else on YouTube, I had a blast flexing my creative muscles and becoming the best player that I could be. Eventually I made the choice to switch to Minecraft Java, which in my opinion is the far superior version (I respect others' opinions on this matter, however wrong they may be (: ) It was around this time that I stopped only using designs from other people and tried to think through the steps myself to reach a solution to a problem. After having made this decision, the fun was magnified greatly because it transitioned from memorizing others' designs to, through trial and error, thinking and working my way towards an end goal that I could be proud of. Until about a week ago, actually, I had only played on my own Single player worlds. Although I had a blast doing this, I recently have started thinking that I would find the game much more fun if I found a quality community to play with! Making friends and collaborating with others on projects or just hanging out intensifies the fun by a ton!","I like the Buffalo Chicken sub from Subway best out of any sandwich at the moment. However, this is largely dependent on which particular Sandwich Artist is making the sandwich, as the sauce distribution varies greatly person to person. Many employees choose to absolutely drown my sandwiches in sauce, creating an inedible, soggy mess. However, by and large, this sandwich has been my go-to since its release.

I remember being terrified of pretty much everything, and spent hours fortifying my tiny wooden house with bricks to protect it from creepers. I had a few single player worlds, and then skipped SMPs entirely and went straight to heavily modded servers. I found my first 'good' community there, but sadly it shut down after a few years. I kept trying to rekindle my love of modded Minecraft, but they ended up feeling kind of pointless.. unlike SMPs everyone just kind of does their own thing till the server dies. I watched a lot of Hermitcraft going back a few years, and realised that what I really enjoyed was the community feeling, so I ended up seeking out SMP servers and ended up finding one I spent 2+ years at. I never achieved or really wanted any sort of rank, but I ended up being quite heavily involved with the community aspect of the server, as well as helping out newer players. Unfortunately due to work-commitments, I had to take a pretty huge step back, and when I tried to come back a few years later most of the people I knew had moved on.","Just wondering, if I were to be accepted, would I be the boomer of the server?

They never took things seriously and didnt pay attention to the people who broke the rules. People in other servers never tried to play and work along with each other and negotiate. If suppose X decided that he wanted this place and Y also wanted this place, then they'd fight and bring their own problems in the server causing havoc instead of negotiating and sharing the place, and this was VERY common. And people just need to be friendly ya'know, but I dont have doubts for that in nodecraft because thats why I like servers with an application :D",I am very passionate about redstone and have great teamwork skills because of things I'll state in the next answer.

I instantly fell in love with it because of the fact that the imagination never ends. If you can imagine it, you can make it. I played it for a long time until I finally got a laptop and got a minecraft java edition account. I used to play it all day long and oh man, the lockdown was just a all-day-minecraft time for me! I did eventually discover programming during lockdown and reduced my minecraft usage but still it was a major game changer for my life. I tried out many many minecraft servers but none of them spoke me as such, i elaborated on the same in the above question haha. I also started watching Mumbo Jumbo around that time and eventually discovered hermitcraft and was legit addicted to it. I used to watch hermitcraft all day long! Some of my favorite hermits include Mumbo Jumbo, Grian, Iskall, Xisumavoid and ImpulseSV. For some time in between, I was also very much addicted to SkyBlock servers and the one I really liked was CosmicSky, my main reason of liking them was because you can do what you want in your own area rather than someone else coming and destroying your builds, but eventually got bored because no friends lmao. Today while going through reddit to find a good hermitcraft-like minecraft server with exceptional commitment and dedication, I found the perfect match for me, nodecraft. Nodecraft had everything I ever wanted, a dedicated community, a hermitcraft-like game play, and a highly positive review. 
And about my life? Ah well, I have always been a loner, never had any friends at school so got on discord, and that too, changed my life. I made SO MANY good friends on discord that I doubt i would ever have made in real life. I got passionate about programming and discovered anime lmao. (i love rom/com anime btw)

We got into server making, even trying to make some ""real"" servers like for example mini-game server. But it didn't went well so we gave up on it. School ended and we parted ways. I was still into Minecraft, I also started programming at that time so I started to make plugins for servers.

I had build a small scale castle, a ship, and a medieval dining hall)
My motivation from Minecraft comes from playing with others, I can play for months if I'm playing with people I like to hang out with. Also the building aspect and participating in community events. I always like both of those because A, when building it challenges you to think about and use every block in your arsenal to make your vision a reality. And community events, I love to set them up, participate, it just adds another way to have fun in the community.","I will play on this server for as long as I can, I'll participate in every season I'm in, and I'll most definitely no life as much as I can lol. A problem I have regularly is when joining a server, I'm one of the only ones left on the server after 3 weeks, everyone else quit after getting max gear. But from what I've seen and heard this seems more like Hermitcraft where max tools and gear just enable you guys to have more fun and get more creative. I want a server like that, that doesn't die after 1 month.","Hermitcraft, Yeah Jarons 100x100 world, Shulkercrafts Survival Series.","I want to build a big bazaar trading town, and a big Egyptian temple/pyramid type thing. Some of my other goals are to make an extremely fun minigame, learn more about redstone, and make new friends. I have some experience with desert building, and when I tried it for the first time it was super fun, and all the houses really looked unique and has this really cool vibe you don't get from most other styles of building. For the fun minigame, I had a couple of ideas, 1 would be a recreation of r/place where you get to replace a piece of wool every day/hour or so. And see what we get towards the end of the season. The Minigame and redstone go hand in hand because to make a fun minigame, you most of the time need redstone so I'm prepared to learn all kinds of things about redstone to make a hit minigame. And for making new friends, the only person I know on the server as of now is VyruZ and so I really want to meet everyone else and see I can make friends with any of them. :D","There's several things that make a great Minecraft community, the people, the overall mood, and the style in which the community plays the game. For the people, you have to have people that are here to be creative, and work with others. If you are in a community and you don't want to work with others at all, you aren't really a piece of the community since you are secluding yourself. The overall mood, if the overall mood is strict or carefree, the community could fall apart, you have to have a mood, which is created by the people on the server, that is accepting, a bit carefree, but also encouraging to others. And the style in which the community plays the game. Most servers I've been on,  other plays are always in a competition or race to be the best, but this server seems to have more of a work hard get rewarded, where nobody is trying to boast about being the best, other than the insane builds,  from an outsiders point of view it looks like the intended way to play Minecraft, and also the best way to have fun.","I want to try and make community events, minigames, and services. By services I mean things like emergency firework rocket stations, emergency food dispensers, community exp farms, stuff like that. It seems like a good way to help the community. For minigames, since I want to learn redstone, I learn by actually using the things I'm learning so building minigames is gonna be one of the ways I challenge myself to learn redstone. I already said before about how I like community events, I really want to participate in some because most servers I've been on, the only community event was the dragon fight, nothing else really. But if I can help creative community events and activities, I think it could be a really good way for me to meet everyone on the server, and to have fun with the community. The community events could be things like homemade skywars map and stuff, another could be ""how far can you fly with one rocket"" and other things like that.","I like to play Apex Legends, Stardew Valley, Terraria, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds. I like to play ""stress free games"" I call them that because most of these games except maybe Apex are pretty relaxing to play. I get really nervous when playing PVP games for some reason. I can be good at them sometimes but I'll be shaking a little bit the whole time. So things like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and Terraria are really fun for me to play. In real life I like to go swimming, and play water polo. I've been swimming since I was really young and recently I moved into a house with a pool so this summer I'll get to do even more swimming.","For SMPs, there doesn't really need to be an end, unless everyone has stopped playing. There's always things to do on an SMP, I feel like once you start having to search and think hard about the next thing to do, you just need to start a fresh project with someone else. But the page SMPs normally end on is once everyone has build their mega base, farms, and have gotten the fun out of the server. But I haven't ever played on a server like Nodecraft, because you guys kept doing stuff even after most of my friends on other SMPs would have quit. So for SMPs I played on before, mega bases and farms are the end goal, but on Nodecraft, its just when everyone wants to move on.","I got into Minecraft from watching Youtube when I was really little, I was watching probably Stampy, DanTDM and iBallisticSquid. I got pocket edition a long time ago on my dads old iPad, and I've been playing ever since, but then in around 4th or 5th grade, my friend told me about java and all the cool things you could do on it. On pocket edition it almost always had a very small world and there wasn't much to do, but on Java my friend said that you could do all kinds of things like even go to the end dimension. So I convinced my parents to let me buy Java and that's where it all started lol. When I was younger I was so scared of dying I never really played in survival, even in creative mode I was scared of mobs. When I first died in survival the first time I played Minecraft, I got so scared of the "" YOU DIED"" screen, I left the room and didn't play until the next day lol. Around 6 months ago, I tried to get into Hypixel Skyblock, but that didnt really work out, if you don't know what hypixel skyblock is, its a VERY grindy version of like Skyblock and Wynncraft mixed together. It has all kinds of custom weapons but its known to require hundreds of hours to get slightly better stats. So in the end it didn't really work out hehe.","Just thought I'd say that this is my second submission, I redid my application cause my first one was kindof mediocre.

Me walking into my classroom and saying hi to my friends. I sat down on the rug because it was time for show and tell. A kid shows off his new cool toy car but then the next kid (lets just call him Jim) Jim stepped out in front of the class to show everyone his new game he got on his tablet. Guess what game it was..... Minecraft! After I saw that I couldn't take my mind off Minecraft for the entire day and got in trouble because I was talking with Jim about this new game he showed me. Once I got home I immediately asked my mom if I could get Minecraft. She said let me look into it and I sat waiting. Later that day she came into my room and said ""Sure! You can get Minecraft."" I was so excited! While I was running to get my iPad she yelled down the hall and said ""But there is one problem."" I was worried that she had changed her mind. When I walked back in she told me how Minecraft cost 6$ and how I would have to help do chores around the house to get the game. It took me about a week to get the chores done but FINALLY I was able to play Minecraft. I bought the game with the $6 that I had just earned and opened up the game. There it was. Minecraft! I played and played for HOURS on end until my mom had to take away the iPad. (About 4-5 years later) I am about 9 years old and I just got back from my grandparent's house. My grandpa just had given me his Xbox to play Minecraft (and other games on). I go set it up immediately and start playing. Before I got the Xbox, my friend Jim had just gotten his first computer. He already was playing Minecraft on it. I watched YouTube videos about java edition, and dreamed about owning my own computer. (2 more years later) I finally get the ok from my parents to start building my computer. I was INSANLY excited. I had been watching Linus Tech Tips for about 4 months now so I am now a PC pro. After the month of waiting for my parts to arrive, I finally build my PC. (Specs: Ryzen 5 3600x, Radeon 580, 16gb of ram, and 2 tb of storage. Also pic of pc is in the best Minecraft build.) I buy then download Minecraft on it. The fist thing I looked up on google was ""Hypixel ip."" I get sucked into the Hypixel Skyblock grind. So here I am Right now sitting at my computer typing this long essay just to get allowed to join a virtual game. I hope you really do consider me to join the server and to help me escape the tight grasp of Hypixel Skyblock. Thank you and have a good day.","Did you like my essay?

In real life, I'm a musician, and I also enjoy videography and have quite the interest in modern technology.",Having been part of an amazing community and being proud when looking back on the world in the future.,"I wouldn't really say that I gradually got into Minecraft. The first time I discovered the game was at a friend's house, where I was instantly hooked to the concept of Minecraft. After that I kept begging my parents to buy me the game, but since I didn't have a good computer to play it on, I didn't really have a way of actually playing the game after purchasing it. That didn't stop me from playing the game however, since I played it every chance I got at my friends' houses. Later when pocket edition first came out, I bought it as soon as it came out, and spent most of my time playing it on a tablet. The game was quite barebones though, and it wasn't anywhere near being similar to java edition, so it never felt as good as playing it on pc. Because of this, my friend lended me his account since he wasn't very active on it so every day after school, I would go to the local library and play it on their computers. When the came out on console, I bought it for my ps3 after saving up for a few months. Finally I could play a proper version of the at home, so this was mainly where I started properly getting familiar with the mechanics and more technical side of the game. I was really into automatic farms and redstone, so I spent most of my time looking into those areas of the game, watching youtubers such as Mumbo Jumbo, just having fun and trying to get better at the game. 
Playing hardcore has a certain charm to it that you'll never find any other way, but singleplayer can feel a bit empty and non-rewarding at times. Being a part of a community not only strengthens you as a player but it also gives everything you do a sense of purpose. That's why I wanted to join a server and community, and I happened to stumble upon a reddit post advertising for Nodecraft.","My favorite sandwich is probably tuna and sweetcorn, but I love to spice things up and try experimental sandwiches.",Speedrunning the game in 34:27 in 1.16 or defeating the enderdragon with nothing but a wooden axe and a water bucket,"I've played on a few smp's before, usually in the form of small communities. Starting out on an smp is always refreshing and exciting, but most of the players leave after milestones such as defeating the enderdragon or getting good enough gear to call themselves almost invincible. On other servers, people usually leave after a month or so, meaning that I'm the only active player left on the server. When this occurs and lasts for a few months, I usually slow down a bit, or go back to focusing on my hardcore world, which I usually have as a backup, that I'll always have in case I get bored of everything else or I have nothing else to play.",,,,

But yeah I got into gaming when I was around 13 due to some quite bad depression which then led to worse anxiety. Because of these things I stayed at home and was very much iscolated from society but in my solice I found gaming was really one of the only things that kept my boat afloat if that makes sense. Something about being able to connect with others without the struggle and stress of real life interaction really sold it to me and I was hooked pretty much straight away. As soon as I could afford a decent enough setup I went to my local computer parts and peripherals store and spent far too much money. Soon after I found my love for gaming I was introduced to Minecraft through my Psychologist who reccomended it as a creative way to enjoy gaming that wasnt just about running around and killing things.

Once this is done dress with barbeque sauce foilowed by extensive seasoning and then simply place the crown bun on top and get ready for a very mouth watering meal!",Gosh I really dont know haha.

Unfortunately with good experiences there are also the bad. If I am being completely honest I can't say I have ever found an SMP that I really felt suited me or my dedication and passion for the game.

It was self-published, and as my first book it obviously wasn't very good, but I write on wattpad these days and hope to publish my second in a year or so. I met my current social group through an smp too.","The reddit post mentioned content creators, are there any channels I should check out? (P.s: pasties and pies beat sandwiches any day of the week).","To date it's probably a small faction I led in a previous smp. The SMP was based around a singular large faction, but they were fairly new to the game. I split from it and started my own, and by the time it began to end, the first faction would bring new players to our base rather than their own. I had a few players tell me my builds inspired them to play regularly, so that's always cool.","The first one I joined was the one I spoke on previously. They took me on board after telling me about the amazingly large builds they had, not knowing that I'd ever played the game. They left for the night after introducing me, and by the time they'd come on the next day, I'd finished the builds they were trying to do. They promoted me to 'head architect' on the second day of me being there. I later started a faction that used a build commission basis, and they have never finished a build without us since.

The second is one I still participate in. It's a community based smp wherein players aim to build mega-bases. We have players from all over the world and I've met some great people there. ",,,,

I've first bought MC at the end of 2014. Back then I had a crappy laptop that couldn't run it. I recently got a PC, that also struggled running it. When I got it, I joined an SMP. Halfway through it, I was decided to switch to bedrock, so I played Bedrock for about a year. I now upgraded my PC (still isn't great), but I've now been playing Java since 1.16 released. I then joined another SMP that ended when 1.17 released. 7 years (if you talk about when I bought it) (2-4 years if you ask how much I actually played the game.","If you look at my time played in my 1.16 and 1.17 survival worlds, it would add up to about 120hours. I have no idea how long I played on any servers/realms. Then if I estimate my Bedrock playtime, it was around an hour a day for a few months. I would estimate about 350 hours. Giving a total playtime of 470hours - if you do not include the time I played when I was quite a bit younger.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oVbhsN7JnqfMx29OxV8Iy1hnuxp_EK1f, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bQfOMAzQ8OH9NXt8qh_QJpvoIvuJm9hO, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ovkNs0gHCE09Cxdj64XHmp0AUAHAXuty, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-NBOHt7e5KUY7veaTD7uwpNDjJn-64Gw, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cmciXhqkRPj-7AE8thfPDw8mJ_adH3Fx, https://drive.google.com/open?id=11yovl-rJhyV1pTNSjxyeU8gfE38kDoPM, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N4y3T6GsjClGOqbmqXtjFMc6C5iZB1D_, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U9oE3p3UR-MQUwuYclyzYDVXJQrd50Kv, https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Xjty9zrOG45jHgOvus6uDthhs8qPGDp, https://drive.google.com/open?id=14JJHpuDflTJ1OIVZNUsePC9WcrwFmXEm",10,"I love the game and the creative aspect to it. It is so simple, but yet, so complex under the those 16*16 pixel blocks. It is a way for me to relax, and not think about anything. Youtubers also inspire me to keep playing. Seeing what they do motivates me to go and play so that I can do the same.","No, Sorry","Mumbo, Grian, Iskall, Etho, Keralis, Tango, LogicalGeekBoy, Pixlriffs, MythicalSausage, Gnembon, Illmango","I want to improve my social skills, and improve my building skills. I am not a great builder.. at all. I am not good with people, I'm am an introvert irl. Playing with a loving and supportive community will help me get out of my comfort zone, and get me inspired to be and build better.","An active playerbase. Friendly admins that listen to the players, and inform us before you do stuff like upgrade to a new version or install mods [I was on a server a long time ago where the admins just did what they thought was good without informing anyone. Stuff like upgrade the server to snapshots, resetting chunks, etc. I didn't like that at all]. I know admins must be in control, but they should be transparent about what they are doing, and they must be willing to listen to suggestions (you guys probably know this already). Trust is also a big factor. I don't want to hide all my items from other players because I don't trust them.","I am not great. I will try my best to be a friendly community member, helping where I can, and have fun as much as possible. My favorite thing on previous SMPs is working with others to build a business empire, taking control of the Shopping district. I would like to do that again.","Games: I love simulation games, I do not like FPS games or anything like that since I hate jump scares. Games I play include: AoE2: DE, Factorio, 112 operator, Airport CEO, Mini Metro, Oxygen not Included, Parkitect, Prison Architect, Rimworld, OpenRCT2, Stardew Valley, Terraria, Two point hospital.","I've never lasted long on an SMP, but my goal for this SMP would be to build an base I like, and to get out of my comfort zone. I do not like end goals like 'defeat the dragon' or 'get an elytra'. Minecraft should end when you are happy with what you've done.","A lot of my Minecraft history has already been mentioned in the ""How much experience have you had playing on other SMP servers? Provide some examples or stories of said experiences if any"" questions, so I'm  just going to talk about some other stuff here. I first got into gaming when I saw the game 'Scrap Mechanic' on youtube. I bought and downloaded it, but couldn't run it. One of my friends later introduced me to Minecraft, and I then bought that and played it. Also couldn't really run it, but I really enjoyed building fireball launchers and castles made out of glass. Fun times that was. After a while I decided to delete my account since I was sooo into it that I didn't do anything else. Later on I bought minecraft again. 
Now, life and school. I am quite smart. Since Grade 4 in school my average in school was above 80%. In Gr7, I blew everyone away when I got 92% - second best in the school. Since High school, I've consistently got around 90%, usually being the 4th smartest in my grade. That's where my priority list comes from:  1. Homework, 2. Summarize school work, 3. Study, 4. Spend time with family, 5. Play games. I do not allow games to come in the way of my school work... I want to study Data science, integrating programs with businesses. When I am done studying, I want to leave South Africa as soon as possible. This country is going backwards, and the future for me ins't looking good.

About the Voice chat thing: I'm from SA, and my home language is Afrikaans, not English. I'm not a great English speaker. I'm shy.

Just some of my background, not everything though.",How far have you guys progressed? Has the dragon been defeated?,"I have not killed the enderdragon or wither on my own - I'm not that good, no. I would say my biggest achievement was building my spawner farms and room. I did it recently, and I just loved doing it. Although all 4 spawners can't be activated at the same time, 2 of them will be active, either the skelly and cave spider spawner, or the 2 cave spider spawners, or another 2 cave spider spawners. Quite cool how I got everything to work together!","As I stated before, I joined an SMP when I got my PC. 'The Hive S3'. Quite fun to play with others - my first time playing on an SMP! It was quite fun, but the admins weren't transparent. Half way through the season, they decided to reset the nether and upgrade to a snapshot of the nether update. This annoyed me quite a bit because I recently built a blaze farm, and lost all the materials. I also couldn't run Minecraft without optifine, so I couldn't play any more. I then decided that I should switch over to Bedrock when 1.16 released. I didn't like playing alone, so I decided to start my own realm there since there weren't any good ones that I liked. It was quite a success, but I never really liked Bedrock. After S2 started, I stepped down as owner, and stopped playing for a while. Running a realm is quite taxing on your mental health. Then, Christmas 2020, I got enough money to upgrade my PC. It isn't great though - just a Ryzen 3 3200G with the integrated graphics. PC parts in SA are expensive, and my PC is actually meant for school work. When I was able to play Java at 60fps, I decided to join another server. 'Hyperion'. It was fun for a while, until school started. All my attention went to school, and I became inactive. The owner announced that he couldn't keep the server running, so it will stop when 1.17 released. When 1.17 came out, I was in the middle of exams, and couldn't play at all. The school holidays then started, and I decided to start my own Singeplayer world. Its fun doing everything yourself, but progression is slow, and there's no one to share what you've built with. So now, I am applying to join this SMP.",,,,

Maybe to have as much fun a s possible.","I am just now realizing I might have written a lot in the rest of the questions as well.
Minecraft has been a constant in my life since I got into gaming, such a weird game, no ending, no recipes for the crafting, no guide, just survive and build.
Minecraft has changed with the years even more with the last few updates, and I have always followed and loved this game. Minecraft was the reason I started streaming and created something of my own that I couldn't have if it wasn't for this game.
Quick thing about myself I have never seen snow and I am moving to Canada next year, I will freeze to death :D
 ","Just one question. Are you happy with the community you have built? Because if you are, then they probably are too, which is the best, hopefully I can be part of it. Good luck in the future.","I streamed minecraft for years and I created a couple SMPs, I believe that the community we built and the love I had for those SMPs is my greatest achievement in minecraft.","One of the best stories I have from an old SMP is when we planned an event, elections, it became so popular that the people who were running for president did their campaigns, giving away diamonds and promising public farms and free cookies, it all ended in a war and instead of choosing one of the candidates all the people in the SMP decided for one King.

I didn't even know how to move, I just bashed my keyboard until I figured out wasd is the way to move. I watched a bunch of lets plays back then and they got me even more hooked. Back then I was scared of zombies and creepers so I never played singleplayer, I'd always find a small server. I can't remember how or when but there was this one server, and I probably put the most amount of hours into it. I could just join and fish and build and do whatever the hell I wanted. I loved it, I played far more than I should have at that age, I would spend my entire day playing Minecraft. After that server, I got bored of basic singleplayer vanilla and smps, I joined prison servers and other network based servers such as Hypixel, Mineplex, The Hive, etc. Here I learned more and more about minecraft and its technicalities, the servers intrigued me and I learned how to run a server. I learned all about MySQL databases and what not regarding minecraft servers. Having this knowledge, I asked my friends if they wanted a server, they said yes. So I went on some random hosting site, bought a cheap package, and we played. My friends are more PvP type players or it kinda sucked because I was a more neutral casual player and didn't like too much PvP and competitiveness. I just wanted to farm things and build and here I was in the middle of a war. Not too long after, everything was destroyed and the server died. So here I lie on my bed writing this form, I just want a community that I trust, that I can rely on, and most of all relate with. I've never been an extrovert and talkative type of guy so to have a community where everyone respects, accepts, and treats each other right would just be amazing. This paragraph was all over the place I know, but I hope you understand what I am trying to say.","What are the server specs? i.e CPU, RAM amount, Storage. Also about the screenshots, I lost a bunch of my worlds so I don't have much evidence about all I've done. You're just going to have to take my word.","Having fun, plain and simple.","I've made servers with friends but as you'll soon read down below (I didn't do the questions in order) they don't play like I do. I did have about 3 singeplayer worlds (mostly because I couldn't find a nice SMP) that were amazing, I have some screenshots that I'll send in the screenshots question. I put so much time into those worlds. Especially this one, where my goal was to build Hogwarts, it sounds stupid, and at the time I was delusional. I had a whole schematic for the build. I made about 5 farms for it because I need (I think) 5 million stone. I made a huge perimeter, but sadly, one day, out of my absolute stupidity, I loaded the world in a new version and it corrupted, I didn't make a backup and didn't have any screenshots.

Didn't use any video walkthroughs as i wanted to test myself, and i nailed it!","I've played on one which is the AdultsCraft server. 

The first year and a bit i loved, i had no issues, i built all the builds you see in the images and helped make spawn better for everyone on the server. Made loads of friends and we had some great times. The one issue i had was that one the server only one person could sell any item. So only one person sold rockets, one sold iron etc. I found this overly restrictive. 

Then the last 6 months, first the server went severely inactive, to the point i'd see no-one for a day or two at a time. No builds were being done, there was no chance for collaboration. Due to inactivity shops were empty of stock and i literally ended up building farms for myself for everything so i could keep up on my builds. 

Then at 1.17 we started a new server, a kind of inbetween server and a lot of things were put to votes. However one of these things was the shopping district rules, i suggested we move to an open district where people are free to sell whatever and put forward my reasons. Admin uploaded a poll and said they'd go with consensus, the vote was 18-3 in favour of an open shopping district. 

The owner deleted the poll and refused to change the rule because the 3 who were against were his moderators. 

This was the end of my time with the server as i found this to be extremely unfair to every other member on the server. So now i'm looking for a new home. ",,,,

It was only two of us so we simply attacked while the owner was offline and quit. There was an encounter before we quit / got banned but it wasn't anything much, we messed around with invis pots and pranked them and stuff.

it's a lot more complicated than that tbh but I didn't wanna bore with all the details. But what I didn't like about that server was the owner himself. It's like he didn't know how to run a server and destroyed a players house without any provocation whatsoever.",,,,

I don't believe that skill in building or redstone matters much in the grand scheme of things, but they are nice to have!

Not much else.","I don't generally like putting end goals on things, as once you reach that, you feel as if there is nothing else to do, or on the other end, you feel like you can never reach it and get demotivated. I love making small goals day by day, and when the end comes, let everything go! Progress is necessary and putting a cap on that in my opinion is a hindrance.","Before this, I was in another Smp, called The Introverts Cove, where if I'm being honest, I had the single best experience with Minecraft that I had ever had. Tons of people that I could talk to and actually connect to, complete freedom to build shops and personal things, and a very good community. I am striving to find that again, and most other smp's cannot fulfill that. They all have very very low standards for general upkeep, maturity, building, community, people that they bring in (if they even have a whitelist), and effort put into things. I dislike servers that have a thousand block line of random materials leading to some obscure portal in the nether, or no pathways or markers, or even effort put into anything at all. Being ""bad"" at building is something that I don't generally think is a thing. As long as you put genuine effort into something I believe it should have at least some credibility. But in most servers it's not that people are bad at the game, it's that there is no effort being put in. I want a server that has a higher standard than most. I got into Minecraft about 8 years ago in kindergarten when one of my friends showed me him playing it on his computer, and I've been obsessed ever since.",ngl an Italian BMT sounds pretty good right now,"I started an entire kingdom with everything planned out, and the name of Vespertine. I had 5  regions planned out, each with different lore and backstories, villages and cities. I was only able to finish one of the regions before the server ended up dying about 3 months in. I had from massive mountains with hordes of gold hidden inside, with a massive dragon skeleton protecting it, to an archipelago that was ransacked by an invading force and was ruined and contained underground aqueducts to travel around the kingdom. Sadly it was never finished, but I plan on conquering something of equal if not greater size!","I have had mainly experience on the Introverts Cove. I joined in season 2, and was around until the bitter end of season 3. I'd say it was around 10 months of actual server, and I enjoyed my experience a lot. Most things that I liked about that server have a lot of similarities to this one! Mainly being the tight knit community, focus on projects and not being a total cluster of chaos like most other smp's, and long lasting worlds to be able to work on!",,,,

In March of this year I got invited to play in a Modded Server, which later ended up being a ""technical"" server. It didnt last long because we were only 3-4 active and pretty much all of them were annoying kids, so I just decided to left.

We would host LAN worlds and do things such as ""battle-dome"", survival worlds (they were extremely limited due to the lack of biomes and very small borders), and other game modes such as hunger games.

Then, I moved to the desktop version of minecraft in 2013. There, I fell in love with factions and HCF. I loved the PvP aspect of the game, and found it extremely enjoyable and satisfying. Playing HCF, I learned how to be apart of a team and how to contribute. Usually there would be fights ranging from 3v3's to 30v30's. It was my job to ensure I was doing as much damage as possible, while providing information, call-outs, and defending my team mates.

Moving on to 2016, HCF had essentially died. I started staffing on minecraft servers, as it was extremely interesting to me. I stopped being a ""player"", and instead focused on enforcing rules and helped maintain servers.

I did staffing for a few years up until 2019, where I stopped playing minecraft due to becoming a full-time mechanic. Fast forward to 2020, I started getting some free-time and decided to give survival a try again. From there, I started getting heavily involved in SMP servers. At one point I was played consistently on 6/7 servers, which was quite the experience. I was driven to create my own server, as none of these servers were as active as I would have hoped. Usually I would be the only player online, or there would just be me and another player.

Fast forward to now, I haven't played minecraft for almost a year, due to not being able to find a new community. I tried for many months to apply to servers and communities, but it was always the two same outcomes, inactivity, or extreme toxicity.

I'm applying to this server, as I now have the free-time and interest to start playing again.","I don't eat sandwiches, but quite like preparing and eating scrambled egg bagels.","Statistically, my single-player world. Apart from that, probably owning my own SMP server which ran for 2 seasons.","I've played on a few dozen SMP's. 1. My own SMP, which lasted two seasons and averaged 15 players online. We had a shopping district and a 5k border, organized dragon fight events, and regular community gatherings. We used the rules of hermitcraft for our shopping district. 1 diamond block per 10 x 10. The other SMP's I played aren't so memorable, as most of them usually end up becoming inactive, or get griefed by a new-comer. I find that most players get too bored prior to the end-game.",,,,

As I'm sure anyone would - I would like to build a base, make some farms. For me, my goals narrow more as I work with others and bounce off of their ideas. I started my very first SMP earlier in the year with no expectations, and ended up becoming the mayor and was promoted onto the staff team.

Making some cool builds is fun too :)","I first started playing Minecraft during the start of the pandemic, when it was recommended to me by my boyfriend who has been playing for years. With nothing else to do, I gave it a try and fell in love with the blend of survival multiplayer and creativity game. My boyfriend is a very technical redstone player, so when we played together I just ended up making all of the farms he made look nice. Eventually I became better at building, and at the beginning of this year applied to be on my first SMP. This SMP pushed be to become better and helped me become more confident in the game. I became part of the staff and have learned a lot about Minecraft that I didn't know before. Unfortunately, that server has become smaller and quiet, with just a few of our friends playing regularly.

One was a home-run server that I played with friends. Another - the one where I became mayor and later staff - I have been a part of 2 seasons. The first season I absolutely loved, and I would say made some very dear friends on. Unfortunately, there were a couple of incidents regarding change of ownerships (I am now a partial owner of this server) and a lot of people have stopped playing.

And I didnt really understand it at the time. It was a weird thing(I wasnt much into Video games at the time). But my father had a Xbox 360, so we eventually got the game. My father was big into Video games at the time, so we played here and there for awhile on MC.

I soon was staying up till 1-2 am on the weekends playing minecraft for 12+ hours every 2 days. I did that for years. Then around 1.4.7 I found Mods for MC on my family PC. So I looked at those. Was never really into the crazycraft type stuff. I was into the technical/magic mods. So I started to play the FTB packs. Which lead to years and years of just playing Modded MC.

So after that we decided not to do that again, later  me and all my friends got Minecraft on the PlayStation 3 and we also played a lot of pixel gun(its still around I think but is a Minecraft inspired fps). I remember being so hyped as I loaded into the oldest tutorial world for the first time it had the old wool Minecraft sign. This is probably a good time to say that all of this was either lan or split screen so we would grab our controllers and head down to play 4 way split screen on one PS3 but is was still really fun. As we got older we stopped playing Minecraft. But I got a little taste of java edition when i asked my dad to install it on his PC. But I didn't play it more that a few hours then I logged off. So school happened I was friends with the same group of friends for 6 years but as we got more and more homework we could most just hang out at school, and that was when we started to split. Because of different times during recess I had no one to hang out with so I found some and I became really good friends with them and I still am Today. But in between all of this I got a laptop which I used to play Minecraft on this was the time where I was good at everything pvp, building, redstone and commands. I played a lot on hypixel but after I got new friends I started to play with them but they all had PS4 and played Minecraft bedrock edition and overwatch and so I decided to get one myself and then I stared to play mc bedrock edition.

The lax, meticulous, or sometimes just goofy interaction between players is the foremost reason that I still play this game after 7 years. 

In my opinion, greater than the project itself is the driving forces and leading voices behind it. It is those minds and personalities that continue to invest me into communities such as these.","Not only do I have the ability and wherewithal to create farms for large amounts of helpful resources, but I also greatly enjoy community building, and will be fairly active for large (or moderate) projects.","I play a lot of steam games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, The Binding of Isaac, Terraria, and others. I also enjoy chess as a more contemporary hobby.","The end goal of an SMP is to create something you are truly proud of. Even if that thing becomes a screenshot and exists as nothing else but a piece of data on your computer, the memory should make you reminisce and smile about the time spent with others of your kin.","Growing up, I didn't have much access to nicer things. So when I was only 12 years old, I began to play this mysteriously charming game on an old family laptop, mindlessly wandering and creating hideous, jewel-encrusted structures all over a barren landscape. Of course this lost its charm in due time, seeing as I was just by myself in doing all this.

In just a few short years I was able to afford the awe-inspiring technology of Minecraft: PlayStation 3 edition. I played the game to it's absolute capacity with my brother, Logan. Over the next few years, I became a somewhat veteran player: I built large homes, farmed resources automatically, and became generally obsessed with the survival gamemode. 

Fast forward to my PC years. I saved up and got a cheap Intel PC at a yard sale. The first game I downloaded, you ask? Well Minecraft of course. This was shortly after the 1.13 aquatic update in 2018, about 3 years ago. I was in the middle of High School, experiencing that normal High School sense of not belonging, and yearning for some deeper freedom. 

While I was trapped in the perpetual cycle of waking up only to detest school and the people inside of it, I made some contacts and put out my time and experience to join an SMP. I absolutely loved the friends and projects we made. At the end of the day, any despair or drama of the day disappeared in the scope of the game. I found myself absolutely enthralled with all things Minecraft, consuming YouTube content, about minigames, about farms, about survival with friends, about anything at all.

This about brings me to the present day. Moved out. Moved on from those isolated days and still finding myself surrounded by this lovely game. I find it calming and the people who play it understand the feeling all so well. It may well be a stretch to say, but this game pushed me through some of the hardest feelings I've ever dealt with, hence why it means so much to me.",Reuben!,"My small group of friends and I completed dominated the economy of a very active Econ SMP server known as Rendezvous. We had massive farms for iron, honey, slime, mob drops, sugar cane, redstone, tools, and so so much more. While hoarding filthy amounts of diamonds, I created a ton of shops, minigames, and contributed massively to community projects with all of this going on. I have never had more fun or experienced greater creativity than when this all happened last year.","As I mentioned before, I played on an SMP entitled ""Rendezvous."" This took place the majority of last year, and largely shaped my outlook on what an SMP should look like. I was good friends with all of the members, including the owner and staff team (of course, with few exceptions for various reasons).",,,,

Then to play some SMPs of my own, and I really enjoy just playing Minecraft, I guess my Minecraft addiction led me to this form.","I personally really enjoy Salt and Vinegar Crisp sandwich, thats straight up crack, I'm actually gonna make one now cause I'm thinking about it.","For me it would be building a Large Dragon. I've never been too good at Organic builds and such, so really trying it and throwing myself into the deep-end and coming out with a pretty good build was probably my greatest achievement.","Quite a bit of experience, after watching Mumbo Jumbo's Season 3 of Hermitcraft, i've always been fascinated and entrenched in the SMP servers, and I've been on a couple. I was playing on Creatonics for a couple years and some others that didn't last as long, but as Creatonics seems to have reached its end. I'm looking for a new server ro splurge hours into. On the server, it was quite similar to hermitcraft itself, community events, shops and silly player antics. A feels good environment with tons of friends to help out, prank a little and build things together. It was a good time! but with the players having to put more time into their own lives people coming on became less and less frequent.",,,,

Like about servers
-Good community
-Big bases and builds
-Good decorated shopping district
-A good active voice calls
-Active players

Dislike about servers
-No active staff (Cheaters such as x-rayers can easily x-ray)
-Server that dies in 1 day
-Server with no community or arrangement
-I didn't like the plugin you guys used where you get a reward for doing an achievement. (It basically made it where elytra shops were useless because u get 2 extra eytras through the rewards).

It was a beautiful spark of interest and has stuck with me all the way until today where I now have my own computer and room (You may be thinking - room..? I was stuck in the same room as my brother beforehand). I used to try and record videos for Minecraft, but after review I decided it was not cut out for me. Minecraft has led me to one of my best friends and helped me grow as a creative mind. After finding that I could play with others I have been in and out of various SMPs- Some good, most bad. My previous one turned out to be over complicated with rules, had weird random bots, and had a very strange roleplayer that did not seem to care much about Minecraft, but more about the adventures of some kid and his pet lizard.

I often find SMPs run by childish individuals and players to be a toxic and poor environment. Multiple times I have left servers by people holding my bases hostage by griefing and admins that care non of it because they find the action humorous. I often leave those servers salty because after I put in work, the admins that were supposed to protect my progress do nothing of it. Afterwards I often quit minecraft for a few days to decompress from the betrayal feelings most servers provide. When I am able to find the right SMP, I work with them for months and have been admins myself until a new season turns and I am satisfied with myself and others. I leave those communities happy and with more friends than I had before I joined. Those communities also allow me to work with the player themselves via voice and game chats to better their experience.",,,,

Rather I would like to write about my life, more specifically how this game actually started my love for engineering and the impact it's had on my life. During the last 3 or So years I've started my delve into engineering and information science and while my teachers and parents played a big role in my picking this field, I believe Minecraft was one of the biggest factors for choosing it. If you think about it Minecraft in itself as a game fosters engineering and intuitive thinking as a core concept. all the farms and building methods came from people who grew up with the game and wanted to add more to the community with the knowledge and experience they've gained through it and even kids who've just picked up the game learn how to use Redstone and the most effective ways to do stuff just by playing the game. It's beautifully done really, the most successful game in the world helping anyone who plays it developed important skills that will benefit them throughout life. I'm getting a bit off-topic so back to my story, Ever since I've installed the game I watched Redstone tutorials and before I started learning how everything worked and interacted with eachother they just seemed like magic but now that I can truly see the innerworkings of things and how everything in the redstone system can correlate to real life logic gates we use to run the computers we play the game on; its just amazing to me. and through me learning the ropes of engineering through courses and schooling its just increased my knowledge of the very game I got into the field by it just loops around so fantastically. And I guess, that's my story and Thank you if you took the time to read this it took alot of time and effort","Sorry I've submitted this so late It just took me a while to think everything over, its totally fine if you want to wait until tomorrow to interview. also I know you said if not but hot roast beef sandwiches are one of my favorite meals.","Almost a year ago now during the middle quarantine me and a group of people gathered off Minecraft Redstone forums bought a server from a hosting site and set out with only one goal: Automate every item in the game. and so we did, it took us months and many people quit but we did complete our goal. I was one of the main contributors and stayed until the end of the group but after we finished everyone's dedication to the world died off with nothing left to do and we split up because other than the project there wasn't anything holding us together. Now while the project was my greatest achievement in Minecraft I still regret not choosing a community that would stay and keep playing together after for the simple purpose of enjoying the game and pushing it to its limits. That is what I hope to find here.",Other than the Survival server mentioned previously I have not played many other SMPs due to the fact that I can't engage with most others. many other survival servers are either very disconnected from the player base or the owners are very inexperienced and don't manage the server properly so I know even If I dedicate my time and effort into the server I either won't leave any legacy in the server or my work will be deleted at the owners whim once they don't feel like running the server anymore.,,,,

The community of the server is by far the most influential factor of my online time. I love building and making farms and challenging myself- so the gameplay itself is good alone, but things that really make me go ""oh! I should hop online!"" is seeing the community active, friendly, and me being encouraged to join them (collaborations, talking, whatever). I'll still spend ungodly hours online strip mining or building (especially when I should be sleeping-) but just liking my builds or having fun with a project isnt enough to keep me coming back to a server, I could do all of that in Singleplayer. So, overall, community is definitely what keeps me motivated the most on an SMP.",,,"I'm not sure what goals I have for a season right away! I do have a few ideas- Make a farm for every item (maybe leading into a store/mall) and decorate it to create an entire town, city, or something of the sort!

I bounce around ideas a lot, I'm not sure what I'll settle on for sure! When I complete my biggest goals, I'll work on smaller ""for fun"" projects- things existing just to be fun/silly, or to test things out. Collaborations, also!

My season-based Megabases are probably the biggest ones. I somehow always manage to bite off more than I can chew, so finally finishing them is always wonderful. But completing difficult farms always is wonderful. Running successful shops are also always great! Honestly I'd argue making friends might make the list on its own. I can think of a lot of projects and ideas and relations that I would consider great- but not necessarily something being my ""greatest"". I always aim for my ""greatest"" when starting a new season/project- but in the end theyre all wildly different and I dont feel theyre comparable! I'm learning and growing with each one, a great achievement as a whole.",,"Usually I'll first ask around the playerbase to see if anyone knows about what I'm struggling to figure out. If they do, great! I'll ask them to give me a walkthrough or link me some informational snippets they think will teach me, and come back with any issues/lingering questions that I can't figure out myself. If, for whatever reason, no one has experience/ideas on what I'm struggling with- usually I'll resort to Minecraft Subreddits or Youtube Tutorials.","A few weeks at least, but preferably a few months. I would say at MOST until the next version of Minecraft came out- but thats a varied time and can be inconsistent. A season should last a few months so everyone can complete their goals- but refresh before everyone gets burnt out and so new players can have the ability to join without feeling overwhelmed by everyone being end-game.","An inactive- or worse, unfriendly community. Those two things alone are enough to kill an SMP for me. I can tolerate scuffles or the occasional accident (things happen and thats okay), and I know no one can be online all the time (I have work and other responsibilities myself) but if no more than the same 1 or 2 people are ever online, or if the community is blatantly rude, homophobic, racist, transphobic, ext* then that will be a very hard ""pass"" from me. 
Myself I am usually capable of playing for a few months without getting burnt out. This time can be in/decreased based on life, or the server, of course. But for the most part I can be on several times a week and not be burnt out for a good awhile. I try to fluxuate projects and spark up collabs or new personal goals to keep myself from getting burnt out.","Builder, Semi-Technical. "

As well as them not being full or end-up projects. As I usually take them to build stuff and not really share it. Yet, I truely can't say they are are worst, as I choose the ""better"" of what I had.
Some information for the Screenshots (I've labeled them SC1-SC6 as the file name, hope it stays), as I believe it is always good to know, what you are looking at:
SC1 - Was one of the ceiling ideas I've presented for my friends, when we play together.
SC2 - Was one of the streets I did.
SC3 - Whe wall, that has never been built.
SC4 - Whe Octopus I build at my friend's base.
SC5-SC6  - Was my last world before Caves And Cliffs, where it went south. First - general idea of ""early days"", second - ??? time after, under the construction I stood before (same bridge gives idea of what and where)
And I want to have a comment on the ""joining voice chat"" scale. I think it all really depends on what your activities are, and how much time you have at the exact moment. If I am here for 10 minutes to join and do one thing, I believe it is kind of unnecessary to join voice chat, as (at least for me), when people join, I expect them to last there for some time, and so I follow the same idea. Additionally, I'd say that joining voice chat may be inconvenient for someone in a specific time, or moment. So, I do not expect people to do so, but also put the same understanding on me.","I don't have any notable achievements,like speedruns, records or reaching something unreachable. Maybe the one I can put here is something like going full play-style circle and now respecting any of them.",,"Perhaps it is interior decorations, as my biulds usually end up being quite empty.","Until people ran out of fun, or there is a major update, which usually pulls people to try things in their worlds first.","The lack of player activities, whatever they are.

You might seem confused as of why I did this but let me explain. It all started when I join Minequack, a lovely SMP with an amazing community. A month after my arrival, they added a datapack that added over 1,000 achieveemnts to the game. I made a goal for myself to get every single achievement in the datapack (unfortunately i only got 800 D:). One of the achievements required starting a raid, summoning the ender dragon, and creating the wither, between 30 seconds of each other, and defeating them all without taking damage. Besides obtaining all the blocks in the game, this was byfar the hardest achievement in the datapack, but I went for it. There really isnt a logical explanation for why I brought a villager to an end city, but it was difficult and kind of fun.",,"I'm really interested in learning more about the technical side of Minecraft, along with, of course, redstone. I can work redstone and all, but I'm not that good (lol).","I believe there is really no answer to the question, ""How long do you believe a season should last?"" In my opinion, there should be a new season when the players decide there should be a new season. If everyone is getting bored, start a new season. If the players have done every last thing possible, start a new season. If lots of new players join and players are ready for a new season, start a new season. With that being said, seasons have usually lasted 2-3 months on previous servers, but the time can alternate between servers based on their quality.","There are a lot of things that make me feel unmotivated to play on a server. The first thing is an inactive player base. An inactive player base removes the whole point of a multiplayer Minecraft world. The purpose is to spend time with other players and play Minecraft. As for the second question, I can only be on the server for about 1-2 hours on weekdays (because of school) and much more time on weekends without feeling burnt out.","I would say I'm more of a technical player. I can build, but I've only built on a smaller scale. In my opinion, building in Minecraft doesn't take skill. Minecraft makes building possible for everyone. Building is a matter of how much thought and imagination you are willing to put into a build. I feel that people shouldn't be judged by the quality of their builds. Minecraft builds aren't supposed to look amazing. Builds are like art."

Though if you want a number I'd say about a year and maybe then revisit how the people are feeling about the world.","Living in biomes that don't inspire me, playing with people that don't bring me joy I guess are the main things. Though it doesn't sound like that will be an issue on this server. How long I can play often depends on external factors but if I'm feeling like that I'll often go and do something outside or play another game for a bit to get me feeling better and fuel my creative juices. Usually other survival/building kind of games.","Mostly a builder and technical player. Only enough to farm for resources in survival though, I can't build any computers or anything. My build style is more often medieval/fantasy but want to get more into steampunk."

It's been a long while since I played on a SMP and it didnt lasted long because the server itself wasnt that good and many people had connection issues, but the couple months it lasted I really enjoyed it and I definitely would have continued playing if the server hadn't closed.

I can say I'm really motivated to get better a building and this community feels like a great place to do so, Also I want to meet people to regularly practice my english speaking skills, which is a cool bonus to keep playing with people.","I'm better at building but I also really enjoy using redstone and building farms, although most of the time I lack the knowledge to design original contraptions."

On one of the SMPs I played on everyone had a Hermitcraft-like shop and we kept competing with each other to get the most diamonds.

After everyone leaves and I'm the last one standing I just keep myself busy with building farms, mining or building. Being alone on the servers did eventually get to me, but I usually managed to hold out for 1-2 months before I quit as well.

There are some people who believe that the game ends with defeating the dragon, but my opinion is that it's a sandbox game and there's just no end to it. Also, I've found that for example if you're getting bored when building you should switch to doing something else, like mining or exploring.","Resource hoarder, explorer, builder"

When no one is active it feels like the work that I am doing is for nothing. I don’t get burnt out easily, even if no one is on I stick to the hope that someone will be on soon.

I have a SMP server now and I am the only one left playing on it. Once I start a project I can't stop the creativity and all I want to do is build. Building is also very therapeutic for me. Something about placing the blocks and eventually having something magical to show for it really makes me keep coming back. Especially if I have a community of people around me to see my creations! It makes me all the more motivated to put my all into a project for that little bit of euphoria I get the first time someone visits one of my new creations. I also think there is so much to learn in this game! I have been playing for 12 years now and I still learn new things constantly! Once I feel comfortable in one aspect of the game there is always something new to add to the ole tool belt,,,"I would love to build an amazing land! I love to add things to my area that draws other players in to visit. For example, my area in my SMP now has a custom duel arena, a Bandit cavern with secret rooms in every building, a zoo, and I am working on a temple that is dungeon style where you would win loot if you make it through! I am someone who is inspired by the place I am building in so I don't have any super specific ideas for what I would want to do exactly. Another goal of mine would be to have a community! I have played on my own for so long I would love to have players all around me and get to see their creations as well.",,,,I believe the end goal for me is being proud of what I have done. I want to leave a world only when I feel I have left my mark on it. Imagining it as a real kingdom full of life as I leave the world for the final time. Also as on any great adventure you hope to leave with friends. I would hope that I would be able to foster new friendships through a shared love of this game and the amazing things you can do in it,,"I would love to hear how long your seasons tend to be! Also I would love to know if you are heavy on lore. I love adding lore to my builds and find that its a great way to add so much more personality to it, though I know it is not for everyone. Also if you would like a tour of my SMP world (That is dead now so I would most likely abandon it if you accepted me) I would be more than happy to show you! It might give you a better sense of what my building style is compared to the few screenshots I added. Thank you for taking the time to read my application! I look forward to hearing back from you","I am very proud of some of my hardcore worlds, something about the one life makes me so proud of what I create. I was also proud of my role on the server TimelessPvp several years ago. Through that server I was able to fall in love with this game in a way that i didn't know I could. Having a community there was so great and I am still friends with many of those people to this day. The friendships that I have formed are definitely something I cherish. I am also incredibly proud of my land on my current SMP. It consists a main island with a temple, 7 large floating islands with large structures on each, a bandit cavern, a zoo, trails leading to everyone else's land and a large nether hub. Seeing what I have been able to create in Survival has been so fun and such a great growing process for me as a player of this game",,I would love to learn more about redstone! It has been a goal of mine to actually learn it this year. For some reason I always avoided it but I have gotten so much better already! I especially would like to know more about it because I love the animation it can add to a build. In a world of squares it's nice to see some movement,The SMP I am on know has been going for about 4 months and it has died out in the other playes activity. I personally wish people were active for longer. I would say 8 months - 1 year would be ideal to me but I would just have to adjust how ambitious I want to be if it were shorter or longer than that. ,"For me I use this game as an escape from reality. When I am surrounded by all those blocks and an endless list of possibilities it is hard for me to step away for long. I am able to play the game for super long periods of time! I tend to play for the most of my evening and have to force myself to get off when I know I have to sleep. As for feeling unmotivated, I think after I finish a project I can sometimes be unmotivated while trying to find inspiration for my next one. I feel that is where a community can come in. Having the support around you to keep you building is always so great. And again, I live for the moments someone visits my house for the first time!","I tend to be a builder most of the time. Though I do love the adventure minecraft offers as well. I have recently been diving into redstone and wish to improve greatly on that this year. When I don't play on a creative world or in my SMP now I tend to be a Hardcore player. My longest world was 783 days, lost it to an Enderman in a very unfortunate accident in the End"

If I do join, I’d like to try a small scale town populated by villagers, probably in a style from around the Mediterranean. I’d like to create a coherent environment. It’d also be really cool to somehow tie my base into someone else’s. ",,,,Looking back at finished projects with pride and fond memories with your friends.,,How’s your day going?,"At some point, I finally broke free from the idea that the material has to make sense and embrace textures as just textures. It made me far more ambitious in block use, though I still have room to improve. 
That orange roof starter house, for example, has both iron blocks, wool, birch, and some stones. Weird as hell! Doesn’t make sense! But it’s way more interesting than just calcite, in my opinion. ",,"Tough question. I’m inclined to say that I want to become more adept at creative plugins so I can build faster. 
I think I struggle most with building at large or small scales. You’ll probably notice with my screenshots that everything but the mountain is at a medium scale, with medium detail. I think the street corner builds are an improvement in this regard, but I still feel uncomfy with the ladders for example. They don’t have a neat IRL parallel, so they don’t make sense, but there’s such an aversion to plainness and flatness in MC building trends, and I’m swayed by it. So, finding more methods of adding small details or simply playing with size more is what I want to learn about.","I’ve definitely changed opinions about this, and now I don’t really know. I think 4 months is actually a substantial time if there’s a lot of activity. 2 months isn’t enough though. My latest survival server set a goal that we’d stay on the map for a whole year, but while I still think that was admirable it just didn’t work for us. Around 6 months seems like a fairly good target. ","Knowing that the world is getting reset in a month sometimes demotivates me, but I’m usually the last to leave. Biggest thing is when I know anything I build won’t be seen by someone else unless I ask them to tour. I can definitely keep playing for a month with near-zero activity but after a while I figure, why build something that only I will enjoy? It saps the reality of the achievement. Starting a new project without anyone to appreciate it feels fruitless.","Builder, but I enjoy mindlessly building farms :)"

I have always wanted to create something big but have always been stopped by my friends disinterest to continue. Which in turn has led me to quit myself. ","As i said previously, lack of players, lack of inspiration and so on. If i can get in the groove i can build for hours. But i have to be properly inspired. I do not have many hours on the weekdays to play because of work and exercise so burning out is much harder when you do not have time to burn out, if you know what i mean. What makes me most unmotivated though is if the server does not have a lot of active players. Then i might as well play on singleplayer. But if there are like at least 3-4 active players then i would have a great time and could play for a long time i believe.","I am a builder. I really using my creativity, in real life i draw a lot and minecraft is just like drawing, but with extra steps (survival) Being able to build something unique, atmospheric or beautiful is something i strive for. I really try to create MMORPG like envirnoments that try to tell a story. Like a city under attack by barbarians outside the walls, or a hidden slum beneath the city, and so on. I am very inspired by games like skyrim, Wow and fantasy movies like LOTR and so on."
